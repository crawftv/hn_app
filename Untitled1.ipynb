There's a distinct body of practice between e.g. the things a YC partner would tell you to do about fundraising, the things a growth stage VC fund would tell you to do about organization building, and the things a self-funded software founder would tell you to do about e.g. testing AdWords copy. There is a certain degree of overlap, in the same sense that all of them overlap someone whose business model is buy-and-hold apartment buildings in Chicago, but there is a reason none of them buy-and-hold apartment buildings in Chicago. By comparison, I feel reasonably confident that six figure SaaS business trying to get to seven is somewhere I understand pretty thoroughly, would almost always enjoy a conversation with that founder, and (napkin math) looks plausibly mutually interesting. Why  now  and not five years ago? It feels like a generation-of-business thing: the reason everybody who made money at Google  Facebook didn't invest five years before they started investing was because they hadn't made money at Google  Facebook. Did the opportunity exist five years ago? Probably, as evidenced by the successes from that generation. Is the opportunity better now?

When I consulted, delivery was  only a portion of the package . Sales work isn't just Convince the customer to buy the engagement, it often required substantial (and often speculative) work on creating proposals, doing client education (Why should I even send email anyhow?), scoping projects, attending conferences, writing publicly (an activity which is both marketing and produced  substantial  value despite not being directly billable), etc etc. Clients were not strictly buying delivery; delivery came with a bundle of requirements like e.g. having to deliver while being insured. This produces client value, because they sensibly don't want to give a commit bit to someone who could accidentally bring down the business and has no meaningful assets if sued. Warren Buffet will happily take that risk off the client's hands, to their happiness, but he won't do it for free. Clients similarly can't engage consultants without lawyers being involved. Lawyers materially de-risk engagements; de-risking is something both sides very much want; professional labor is not free. Clients benefit from receiving trade credit (the consultancy will advance you $60k of value and you pay them back months later, with no interest charged, minimal underwriting, and  functionally no recourse in event of default ); trade credit isn't free. From the perspective of a W-2 consultant, the things you get from the enterprise include having predictable work lined up by people who specialize in getting gigs and scheduling them so that you can focus on delivery. The set of technologists who can deliver is much larger than the set who can both deliver and convince software companies to pay premium rates for their time. (Trivial proof that this is true: look how many delivery-focused technologists say that business owners on HN are blowing smoke about rates clients are happy to pay every time that subject comes up.) The consultancy insulates the consultant from market risk; regardless of whether the consultancy is having a good month or a bad month in pipeline or cashflow management payroll happens on the day everyone expects it to in exactly the amount they expect it to. The consultancy invests in the professional development of their employees and in the specialization of their offering on the marketplace, which specialization increases the market value of their employees  while at the consultancy and in the future . There is a way for delivery-focused employees to get ownership. It is to become a principal consultant. Some firms offer promotion tracks which get one there. The faster option, if a delivery-focused employee thinks that the enterprise is not adding value, is to walk out the door and hang out their shingle. If the delivery-focused employee was right, they  immediately  have 100% ownership of the enterprise. If they were wrong, oh well, capitalism happens to capitalists.\",\n",

Robinhood also likely expects to not become the park-your-money account of choice for older dentists but rather to become the spend-your-money account for their millennial userbase. With high velocity of money and low balances the interest expense is minimal and, to the extent they use debit cards, the interchange revenue can be material. (In a stylized example where someone makes $2k a month and spends $200 on debit card purchases and $1.8k on rentetc the interest cost for the year is ~$30 and the debit card interchange for the year is ~$60, even ignoring potential interest revenue.)

Then it's almost always a security. Quoting Marine Bank v. Weaver:  The definition of security in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is quite broad. The Act was adopted to restore investors' confidence in the financial markets, and the term security was meant to include the many types of instrument that, in our commercial world, fall within the ordinary concept of a security. The statutory definition excludes only currency and notes with a maturity of less than nine months. It includes ordinary stocks and bonds, along with the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits. Thus, the coverage of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws is not limited to instruments traded at securities exchanges and over-the-counter markets, but extends to uncommon and irregular instruments. We have repeatedly held that the test 'is what character the instrument is given in commerce by the terms of the offer, the plan of distribution, and the economic inducements held out to the prospect.' The formal definition:  The term “security” means any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a “security”, or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing.\",\n",

Speaking solely for myself, but gesturing in the general direction of my peer set: there exist some software entrepreneurs who have substantial operational expertise and have made some money, but who do not feel like they'd add much value in the unicorn hunt, partly due to access reasons and partly due to different skills. There's a distinct body of practice between e.g. the things a YC partner would tell you to do about fundraising, the things a growth stage VC fund would tell you to do about organization building, and the things a self-funded software founder would tell you to do about e.g. testing AdWords copy. There is a certain degree of overlap, in the same sense that all of them overlap someone whose business model is buy-and-hold apartment buildings in Chicago, but there is a reason none of them buy-and-hold apartment buildings in Chicago. By comparison, I feel reasonably confident that six figure SaaS business trying to get to seven is somewhere I understand pretty thoroughly, would almost always enjoy a conversation with that founder, and (napkin math) looks plausibly mutually interesting. Why  now  and not five years ago? It feels like a generation-of-business thing: the reason everybody who made money at Google  Facebook didn't invest five years before they started investing was because they hadn't made money at Google  Facebook. Did the opportunity exist five years ago? Probably, as evidenced by the successes from that generation. Is the opportunity better now? Plausibly yes, as demonstrated by all of the people who were successful writing down what they did, doing technology transfer on that to new operators (often for free), the ecosystem radically improving (inputs, platforms, employees, exit options all got a bunch better), etc.\",\n",

When I consulted, delivery was  only a portion of the package . Sales work isn't just Convince the customer to buy the engagement, it often required substantial (and often speculative) work on creating proposals, doing client education (Why should I even send email anyhow?), scoping projects, attending conferences, writing publicly (an activity which is both marketing and produced  substantial  value despite not being directly billable), etc etc. Clients were not strictly buying delivery; delivery came with a bundle of requirements like e.g. having to deliver while being insured. This produces client value, because they sensibly don't want to give a commit bit to someone who could accidentally bring down the business and has no meaningful assets if sued. Warren Buffet will happily take that risk off the client's hands, to their happiness, but he won't do it for free. Clients similarly can't engage consultants without lawyers being involved. Lawyers materially de-risk engagements; de-risking is something both sides very much want; professional labor is not free. Clients benefit from receiving trade credit (the consultancy will advance you $60k of value and you pay them back months later, with no interest charged, minimal underwriting, and  functionally no recourse in event of default ); trade credit isn't free. From the perspective of a W-2 consultant, the things you get from the enterprise include having predictable work lined up by people who specialize in getting gigs and scheduling them so that you can focus on delivery. The set of technologists who can deliver is much larger than the set who can both deliver and convince software companies to pay premium rates for their time. (Trivial proof that this is true: look how many delivery-focused technologists say that business owners on HN are blowing smoke about rates clients are happy to pay every time that subject comes up.) The consultancy insulates the consultant from market risk; regardless of whether the consultancy is having a good month or a bad month in pipeline or cashflow management payroll happens on the day everyone expects it to in exactly the amount they expect it to. The consultancy invests in the professional development of their employees and in the specialization of their offering on the marketplace, which specialization increases the market value of their employees  while at the consultancy and in the future . There is a way for delivery-focused employees to get ownership. It is to become a principal consultant. Some firms offer promotion tracks which get one there. The faster option, if a delivery-focused employee thinks that the enterprise is not adding value, is to walk out the door and hang out their shingle. If the delivery-focused employee was right, they  immediately  have 100% ownership of the enterprise. If they were wrong, oh well, capitalism happens to capitalists.\",\n",

Your gross revenue contribution is approximately $231,000. Your employer has approximately 20% overheads; that knocks it down to $185k. They'll want to keep somewhere in the 15~20% of gross range as their profit; that leaves about $140k.

Their primary revenue stream was, once upon a time, net interest income, but these days due to the extremely low interest environment and alternate sources of funding the revenue stream is more weighted towards fees (primarily NSFs, although that was hit a few years ago) and debit card interchange. Robinhood also likely expects to not become the park-your-money account of choice for older dentists but rather to become the spend-your-money account for their millennial userbase. With high velocity of money and low balances the interest expense is minimal and, to the extent they use debit cards, the interchange revenue can be material. (In a stylized example where someone makes $2k a month and spends $200 on debit card purchases and $1.8k on rentetc the interest cost for the year is ~$30 and the debit card interchange for the year is ~$60, even ignoring potential interest revenue.) This is roughly in the same line as their core strategy, which is spending what would otherwise be a marketing budget on keeping commissions at zero, making money on the other ways brokerages make money. If you do not understand how a brokerage makes money, I encourage you to peruse the annual reports of e.g. eTrade or TD Ameritrade, which will happily explain their revenue sources and why commissions are a surprisingly small portion.

Then it's almost always a security. Quoting Marine Bank v. Weaver:  The definition of security in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is quite broad. The Act was adopted to restore investors' confidence in the financial markets, and the term security was meant to include the many types of instrument that, in our commercial world, fall within the ordinary concept of a security. The statutory definition excludes only currency and notes with a maturity of less than nine months. It includes ordinary stocks and bonds, along with the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits. Thus, the coverage of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws is not limited to instruments traded at securities exchanges and over-the-counter markets, but extends to uncommon and irregular instruments. We have repeatedly held that the test 'is what character the instrument is given in commerce by the terms of the offer, the plan of distribution, and the economic inducements held out to the prospect.' The formal definition:  The term “security” means any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, security-based swap, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a “security”, or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing.\",\n",

They're really good and we couldn't do this without them, but they're probably not the lynchpin to making this work at scale. We're working constantly on improving the integration of peers throughout the company. Something Stripe Atlas does, for example, is schedule time for the team to low-key socialize without an explicit agenda, in part because by default some decisions get made in a hallway and some information travels at the speed of coffee, and we've learned we should go out of our way to be inclusive of employees who don't passively benefit from those factors. I cannot conceive of a reason we'd track screen time for employees, remote or otherwise. I can model why a company which had an adversarial relationship with employees might want to do that (to discourage shirking). We do not have an adversarial relationship with our employees, and (hopefully) have more interesting utility functions than that. I expect we'll continue publishing what we learn on this in Increment, our engineering blog, and other places. It seems unlikely to me that five years from now instituting this policy will be very contentious at well-run tech companies; that implies we, as an industry, have to get much better at this  very quickly . We're always happy to share what we've learned.\",\n",

This business requires speculators to be able to move money in and have the expectation of getting money out. Bitfinex could not credibly provide that after they lost the ability to clear USD-denominated wires when Wells Fargo cut them off (technically, declined to be an intermediary bank for their Taiwanese banks' wires) for AMLKYC compliance issues. So they took what was then a fun little crypto side project and got people to believe it was the next best thing to a fiat onramp. This, somewhat incredibly, worked. Then the rest of the crypto economy glommed onto the fact that this is  really useful  for them, because tether was much more AMLKYC friendly (in the sense that you could use it when your name was Ima Moneylaunderer) than USD-denominated rails typically are, and it fulfilled a liquidity-preserving function similar to casino chips. The cryptocurrency community produces essentially no value via sale of services outside of the community, so the balance of payments always has to satisfy We can only pay out as much hard currency as people have deposited. Prices only keep going up to the extent that folks don't try to withdraw the money. Tether encourages people to realize gains but keep their gains on the table. (The community thinks that the main use case is facilitating inter-exchange liquidityarbitrage but given sufficiently well-capitalized arbitragers tether provides no benefit over We are capable of keeping a ledger of our activities in a database of our choice.) Those are the main reasons why. I strongly suspect that the community, once it realized that Tether was imperiled, brought several competing stablecoins to market because they both a) realized the systemic utility of stablecoins and b) were attempting to avoid the entire ecosystem vanishing in a nuclear fireball as tether unwound. Who knows, maybe they'll succeed.\",\n",
