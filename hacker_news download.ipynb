I don&#x27;t know what the answers are, but let&#x27;s consider what statistics would be useful to defend your statement.<p>First, since you are talking about air-conditioning, we can probably restrict to summer temperatures.  It&#x27;s not clear if we can look only at daytime highs, since higher temperatures at night are also uncomfortable.   Since we&#x27;re talking about a threshold, we can probably restrict to the single hottest month.  For Phoenix (and I&#x27;d guess the rest of the Southwest?) this looks to be July.<p>So to tell a compelling story, you&#x27;d probably want to show that the average high or average low for July has increased significantly since the time the building was built.  How much is significant?  I don&#x27;t know, but if the claim was that it didn&#x27;t need AC when built (as opposed to saying that it needs it more often now) I&#x27;d think we&#x27;d want to see a change of about 5F (2C).   There might be a good argument for a lower number (perhaps humidity has also increased?), but it likely would be less convincing than a large jump in temperature.<p>Finally, you&#x27;d want to show that the increase in temperature is due to climate change, rather than the effects of urbanization.  More blacktop, more buildings, and more air conditioners (!) will increase the number on the thermometer in an urban environment even if the climate hasn&#x27;t changed.   On the bright side, most published temperature records have already been adjusted to remove these Urban Heat Island effects.  But do realize that your perception that it is hotter might be affected by the build up of the environment, so the temperature either needs to be measured outside of urban areas, or adjusted for the non-climatic changes.<p>So instead of taking offense, could you perhaps point to a historical chart of July temperatures for where you live, showing that the temperature (adjusted for urbanization) has increased significantly since the buildings were built?',\n",

You should look through the typescript issues related to jsdoc. Additionally, it&#x27;s a bit of a mess trying to output declarations if you mix ts and js because enable checking js disallows emitting declarations, and declarations are only emitted for ts. You can get around this by setting your editor to check js, but leaving it off in the config. But then at that point I have no idea how you&#x27;d create documentation for that.<p>In general, contrary to what you&#x27;d expect, documentation options for ts seem poor. Typedocs is painful and ugly. I&#x27;ll be trying DocFx next but it looks like it has a complicated workflow.<p>Also you should imo have some typescript experience to be able to write the jsdocs in a way that they work how you expect (e.g. typing a parameter as an object does not work how you would expect, it).<p>So next thing I thought was to just write js and accompany each file with a manual .d.ts definition. This works when you consume the exports of the file but it doesn&#x27;t when you&#x27;re within that file (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;issues&#x2F;30304\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Microsoft&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;issues&#x2F;30304</a>) which makes it useless imo.

The difference is comapring it to most capitalistist countries, in an average capitalist country the p50 user has a good life and your wealth does not depend on your party membership or being in the social circle of party members. People can succeed by putting in effort. I think many of the people in the US like AOC think that they can just tax the rich and live off those people, using the exactly same arguments that Marx.

Its portability between platforms and user friction.<p>In the era of VHS-DVD-BluRay one could buy movies, and they play in any player.  When I get a new player, it just works.<p>Now, we need to juggle accounts, billing, subscriptions, and player authorizations.  Having a FireTV and Roku plugged into each TV is an absolute pain in the ass.<p>What needs to happen is the establishment of a standard protocol for providing content and authorization.  Each layer of the problem needs to be abstracted and compartmentalized.  The Apple App world destroyed the server-client relationship.<p>First there needs to be a standard protocol for a service provider to deliver content after receiving authorization.<p>Next there needs to be a standard aggregation protocol.  This is the step everyone misses.  The best analogy I can think of is the Google Reader to Feedly-Innoreader relationship.  I could set up Google Reader with my config, and then sign into ANY other compatible front end that supported Google Reader and use their product without setting it up from scratch.  I want a place that combines MoviesAnywhere with billing management.  One place to go to subscribe and cancel subscriptions.  This place might just be an API with no client front end, the actual interfacing with the service could be handed off to the clients.  People might reply Roku or Apple, but they still miss the point that if I set up a Roku, my config isnt portable to Fire or Apple or Google.  I can access my same Gmail and Amazon account from Firefox and Chrome without rebuilding my profiles and losing my config.  HTTP&#x2F;HTML is what makes the Web Server&#x2F;Web Browser relationship so beautiful, anyone can implement it.<p>Finally there needs to be an open way for anyone to write a client that connects to the aggregation services.  Consumers should be able to have a Roku in one room and a FireTV in another, and an LG in another.<p>As long as each client vendor tries to suck people into their ecosystem, and as long as each service provider wants to handle subscriptions and billing themselves (or the client apps trying to take it over so Amazon&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Roku manage my billing) people will continue to find the friction and lack of portability to be too big a pain in the ass.  It sucks to have to commit to being an Apple or Google or Amazon or Roku house.  It sucks that each service provider has to write a client side app for Apple, Google, Amazon, and Roku and that upstart services sometimes can only support some of them.<p>As long as Layers 1-3 are combined into 2 frankenlayers, consumers will continue to grow more frustrated as more services pop up, and become more trapped in ecosystems.<p>Layer 1: Video Provider - CBS, Netflix, Disney<p>Layer 2: Subscription Manager - ???<p>Layer 3: Media Player - anything the consumer wants, never trapped<p>Piracy Solves this problem.<p>Layer 1: Video Provider - Usenet, Torrents<p>Layer 2: Subscription Manager - Plex, Emby, DLNA, media servers<p>Layer 3: Media Player - Kodi, or any competitor.<p>Just like how I can sign into the same gmail account from any client, I pray for the day I can walk up to a media center, sign in, and load my lifelong profile, without needing the media player to be proprietary-compatible with each and every service provider, and without needing to sign into 20 services to see what&#x27;s playing.

It needs to meet deadlines, and match expectations.<p>But I have dozens of projects sitting around that exist just for the sake of existing, or for some goal that is more about &quot;because I think it&#x27;d be aesthetically pleasing&quot; than because it&#x27;s practical.  Many people do. Sometimes it is an exploration of code for the sake of code. Sometimes it is an exploration of the effects of code.<p>Some of them might become practical one day. Then they&#x27;ll cease to be as fun as they are now. I just spent most of the night wrangling a garbage collector for my ahead-of-time Ruby compiler for example - first time I&#x27;ve been able to spend serious time on it for a couple of years. The entire project is very much &quot;because I can&quot; and &quot;because it pleases me&quot; than for practical reasons; I make choices I wouldn&#x27;t make if I needed to get something working within constraints. I make choices that actively cause more effort.<p>But conversely a lot of practical code has a feeling of art as well, in that there is the straight-forward way of doing it, the way everyone is used to, and then there is that way of doing it that blows your mind by showing possibilities you had not even imagined. Examples of that to me would be TCCBOOT [0]. The story of TCC itself is art to me - the original obfuscated version was 2048 byes of source. But to then take that, and turn it into something very little more and make it compile an OS during boot was not a practical goal, and not driven by utility - it was a mindbending demonstration of the possibility of producing a compiler that could compile a kernel from source and be competitive with loading a pre-compiled binary, and the beauty of what you can achieve with that simplicity. Nobody uses it. That&#x27;s not the point.<p>The point is a lot of who saw it went on to think differently about how dynamic systems can be.<p>Massalin&#x27;s Synthesis kernel [10] stands out to me as another example that for me crosses the boundaries and is both outstanding engineering and art in challenging the ideas of how systems could be built in ways that make me look at it just as much because of the beauty of it as because of the practical ideas. (The main thing it brought was the idea of making the kernel <i>adapt</i> to its clients by generating custom code for system calls; to me it is art because it turned the idea of a kernel as something static on its head; and conceptually we&#x27;re still just scraping the very surface of dynamic code generation in kernels that Massalin&#x27;s thesis started playing with). There are many works like that, where the specific implementations are irrelevant - nobody uses the Synthesis kernel - but where the ideas are as important as any expressed in more overt or &quot;intentional&quot; art.<p>&gt;  Furthermore, there are clearly-defined constraints: you cannot smith an axe and call it a sword, just as you cannot write a web scraper and call it a raytracing engine.<p>You might just find someone do that just to spite you. Just like someone wrote a paper on translating images of paint splatters into Perl [1] for the sake of it.<p>In fact someone has been there, done that, already, sort of [2] - not ray-tracing, but an art installation that downloaded random 3d models with a scraper and combined them.<p>Specific tasks and projects have constraints. Outside of that people make what they want, often for no particular reason, or for reasons that in retrospect look totally idiotic.<p>&gt; Art does not have this limitation. Art does not have this limitation. In any art medium, you can imagine creating a horribly mangled artifact, like a canvas smeared with random colors, or a piece of discordant music, or a violently disorienting video game -- and yet these would still be considered art. But a program full of syntax errors is like a cracked sword without a hilt: useless. Art cannot be useless.<p>Software is full of horribly mangled artefacts that are considered valuable for the sake of it. The IOCCC [3] is a prime example, but so many projects I admire are projects that have all kinds of fatal or less fatal flaws but have <i>something</i> about them that is more art than craft. The entire history of esoteric languages [4] for example is about communicating ideas rather than making something <i>useful</i>. Sometimes they are mocking other languages - like INTERCAL, with it&#x27;s wordy syntax drawing parallels to COBOL and FORTRAN, and it&#x27;s reverse goto (come from) making regular goto&#x27;s seem trivial - sometimes they are an exploration of minimalism, like Brainfuck, sometimes they are an exploration of what is possible - in Befunge control flow changes the <i>direction</i> source code is read in.<p>Whole categories of software has more to do with the aesthetics or other textual aspects of the program than utility - quines, obfuscated programs and golfing springs to mind.<p>Often the crossover is very direct: Whole genres of art are intimately tied with programming: Chiptunes are both closely tied to the hardware of the platforms they originated from, but many subsets are also intrinsically linked to a history where musical scores where expressed using custom players where musicians where often also the person to code the player. Rob Hubbard [5] is a famous example of a musician whose music was expressed as code (it was driven by data, but most of his C64 tracks are data for a single, specific iteration of his player code, so having &quot;score&quot; is insufficient; the score is incomplete without the code).<p>Many of his tracks stand out not just because of the musical qualities, but because they represented code as art. E.g. the Monthy on the Run theme [6] was renowned because of the technical challenge of getting <i>that close</i> to sounds of a string instrument on something as crazily basic as the C64 SID chip. I like the tune, but the masterpiece of art in that work is figuring out how to do <i>that</i> with patterns as simple as <i>this</i>: [7]. Another classic example would be his music for International Karate [8] which is a track I still love that is less impressive in terms of code (because the track demands less), but that still demonstrates an impressive mastery off both.<p>From the same era we also see graphics expressed as code to a greater and greater extent: The exploration of computational graphics became more and more important, but also the exploitation of the capabilities of the available systems to make graphics that was linked intimately to code. E.g. the various &quot;FLI&quot; modes on the C64 [9], or even just plain demos, where the code was part of the artwork: the systems could not display the art without the co-mingled code.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bellard.org&#x2F;tcc&#x2F;tccboot.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bellard.org&#x2F;tcc&#x2F;tccboot.html</a> and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bellard.org&#x2F;otcc&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bellard.org&#x2F;otcc&#x2F;</a>\\n[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;programming&#x2F;comments&#x2F;b9fqwj&#x2F;93_of_paint_splatters_are_valid_perl_programs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;programming&#x2F;comments&#x2F;b9fqwj&#x2F;93_of_p...</a>\\n[2] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.customarttools.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2016&#x2F;2&#x2F;26&#x2F;fmdelivery\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.customarttools.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2016&#x2F;2&#x2F;26&#x2F;fmdelivery</a>\\n[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ioccc.org&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ioccc.org&#x2F;</a>\\n[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esolangs.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Esoteric_programming_language\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esolangs.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Esoteric_programming_language</a>\\n[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.c64-wiki.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rob_Hubbard\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.c64-wiki.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rob_Hubbard</a>\\n[6] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4EcgruWlXnQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4EcgruWlXnQ</a>\\n[7] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YIA_0cvS2gQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YIA_0cvS2gQ</a>\\n[8] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dvmSpZWW45k\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dvmSpZWW45k</a>\\n[9]<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.studiostyle.sk&#x2F;dmagic&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;gfxmodes.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.studiostyle.sk&#x2F;dmagic&#x2F;gallery&#x2F;gfxmodes.htm</a>\\n[10]  <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scs.stanford.edu&#x2F;nyu&#x2F;04fa&#x2F;sched&#x2F;readings&#x2F;synthesis.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scs.stanford.edu&#x2F;nyu&#x2F;04fa&#x2F;sched&#x2F;readings&#x2F;synthesi...</a>',\n",

While it is true that gas&#x2F;diesel has a higher energy per tank as well as a faster tank &#x27;fill&#x27; time, this does not make up for the far higher cost per mile for the liquid fuels, AND the complexity of thousands of small parts threshing and wearing away.\\nElectric motors are routinely made to run for 100,000 hours and upwards, because they have rotary bearings and only torque to contend with versus the 2500 rpm of IC engines with bearing impact bangs of the IC engine many times per revolution, and the timing belts, and the tappets hammering and the valves burning away, and the muffler and pollution control gizmos rotting and crumbling away. And brakes, with regenerative braking (which wears nothing) we have already seen brake linings on Teslas and others hit 500,000 miles - more?  I can see an era of polyurethane(PU) tires also good for 500,000 miles. They cost more, but they run more and are a lot tougher against road damage than rubber. Sure, any fool can burn rubber and jam on the brakes and, in effect, burn $$ to kill them faster, but I am betting that regen braking as well as more AI in the control box that has the potential to avoid almost all friction based braking, because that AI knows your route (mostly - from experience), when to slow with regen for the turns and curves.\\nThe moving hand writes, pauses, points it&#x27;s thumbs down, and moves on. IC engines are in a downwards race to nowhere.<p>It looks like there is no lithium shortage at all. Cobalt looks like a scarcer element, which adds cost, but electrode design is improving almost monthly and less cobalt is needed. In addition, cobalt is a recyclable material and this will soon be almost 100% captured for re-use, as the growing shortage drives the reward for recycling it.',\n",

It really makes me try to avoid contact with the digital publishing industry as much as possible. What we see now is the movie studios&#x27; response to that which is:<p>- To increase the size of the data dramatically (4K+ video) so that casual sharing requires hardware investment and thus remains difficult<p>- To make things highly dependent on a very specialized backend to work correctly (Netflix&#x27;s recent experiment with branching narratives)<p>- To start bundling it with other things (Amazon Prime)<p>- To offer streaming analytics as a better data platform than the traditional Nielsen ratings<p>- And probably more I can&#x27;t think of right now<p>The thing is that these are all real value adds which I am glad to see them competing on. Right now all the downstream vendors are forced to invest in rolling their own DRM.

If they redefine success as something other than growth and user retention, maybe they can create a fake kind of success, but this site will not grow users or any of the things a normal startup looks for when launching a product (...)</i><p>Here is a thing: nobody in the community cares. The regular posters, commenters and voters don&#x27;t care about &quot;growth and user retention&quot; beyond &quot;people like it in here&quot;. Lurkers and irregular visitors don&#x27;t care about it either, they&#x27;re interested in actual content the community curates. Communities like subreddits exist so that people with like interest can exchange thoughts and media about those interests together. That somebody monetizes them indirectly through ads is an artifact of hosted platforms, but nobody will be willing to abandon a perfectly good one just because someone related to the community wants to take this money for themselves instead.<p>Imagine this: a guy got together some people and started organizing regular open poetry evenings in a coffee shop in the center of a city. The event became successful, grew quite an audience; the coffee shop wanted it there (as it drove foot traffic), so it kind of kept organizing itself. Fast forward couple years, the original organizer suddenly announces that from now on, the meetings will take place in a coffee shop he just opened on the outskirts. How do you think the regular guests and performers would react? I imagine they&#x27;d laugh the guy out of a room - it&#x27;s ridiculous to leave a perfectly good meeting place and move to the middle of nowhere just because one person <i>really really</i> wants to make money off them. I imagine if the guy was telling the guests to go elsewhere next time, the coffee shop itself would step in and kick the guy out.',\n",
